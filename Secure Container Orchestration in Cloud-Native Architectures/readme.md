Secure Container Orchestration in Cloud-Native Architectures
Overview
This repository contains resources and implementations related to secure container orchestration in cloud-native architectures, developed as part of NYIT's 775 Datacenter Security course. The project focuses on securing containerized applications and their orchestration in modern cloud environments.

Key Components
1. Secure Container Deployment
Hardened container images with minimal attack surfaces

Security-focused Dockerfiles and build configurations

Image scanning and vulnerability management

2. Orchestration Security
Kubernetes security configurations

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementations

Network policies for secure pod communication

Secrets management solutions

3. Runtime Protection
Runtime security monitoring tools

Anomaly detection mechanisms

Intrusion prevention systems for containers

4. Compliance Frameworks
Implementations of CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes and Docker

Compliance as code configurations

Audit logging and monitoring setups

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker installed

Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for local development)

kubectl configured

Helm (for some deployments)

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/BrenesRM/NYIT-775-DatacenterSecurity.git
cd NYIT-775-DatacenterSecurity/Secure Container Orchestration in Cloud-Native Architectures
Deploy the security components:

bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
Usage
Scanning Container Images
bash
docker scan <image-name>
Applying Security Policies
bash
kubectl apply -f policies/
Monitoring Security Events
bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
Security Features
Pod Security Policies: Implemented to control pod creation privileges

Network Segmentation: Network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication

Secrets Encryption: Kubernetes secrets encrypted at rest

Audit Logging: Comprehensive audit logs for all cluster activities

Runtime Security: Falco-based runtime security monitoring
